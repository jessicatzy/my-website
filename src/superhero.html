    <p>A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered <strong>super-hero</strong> or super hero) is a type of heroic stock
        character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the
        public, and usually battling supervillains. A female <strong>superhero</strong> is sometimes called a <strong>superhero</strong>ine
        (also rendered <strong>super-hero</strong>ine or super heroine), although the word <strong>superhero</strong> is
        commonly used for females also. <strong>superhero</strong> fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s. By most definitions, characters do not require actual
        superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed <strong>superhero</strong>es.[1][2][3] While the Dictionary.com definition
        of "<strong>superhero</strong>" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers
        and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition
        as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5]
        Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters
        such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as <strong>superhero</strong>es but nevertheless share
        similar traits. Some <strong>superhero</strong>es use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats
        against humanity from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains
        will be the <strong>superhero</strong>'s archenemy. Some long-running <strong>superhero</strong>es such as Batman,
        Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have
        a rogues gallery of many villains.

        Early History
    </h3>
    <p>The word '<strong>superhero</strong>' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric
        heroes as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play <em>the scarlet pimpernel</em> and
        its spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the <strong>superhero</strong> trope of a secret identity.[7]
        Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic
        strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including
        Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]
        In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon
        Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the
        Magician[11][12][13] (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic
        Books.

        1940s
    </h3>
    <p>During the 1940s there were many <strong>superhero</strong>es: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this
        era. This era saw the debut of first known female <strong>superhero</strong>, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character
        Fantomah, an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with
        superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous
        "Barclay Flagg".[14][15] The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs
        using the superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper
        comic strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.[16] One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a
        rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to
        Hell — debuted in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most
        of the other female costumed crime-fighters during this era lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman
        in Red,[17][18] introduced in Standard Comics' Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper
        comic-book insert The Spirit Section June 2, 1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in All-American Comics
        #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury,[19] debuting in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6,
        1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced in Quality Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,[20][21] introduced
        in Harvey Comics' Pocket Comics #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947)
        as a supporting character.[22] The most iconic comic book <strong>superhero</strong>ine, who debuted during the Golden
        Age, is Wonder Woman.[23] Modeled from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist
        William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne.[24][25]
        Wonder Woman's first appearance was in All Star Comics #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one
        of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944.

    <h3 id="section-c">
        1950s
    </h3>
    <p>In 1952, Osamu Tezuka's manga Tetsuwan Atom (more popularly known in the west as Astro Boy) was published. The series
        focused upon a robot boy built by a scientist to replace his deceased son. Being built from an incomplete robot originally
        intended for military purposes Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and
        the incredible mechanical strength of his limbs. The 1950s saw the Silver Age of Comics. During this era DC introduced
        the likes of Batwoman in 1956, Supergirl, Miss Arrowette, and Bat-Girl; all female derivatives of established male
        <strong>superhero</strong>es. 1958 saw the debut of <strong>superhero</strong> Moonlight Mask on Japanese television.
    </p>

    <h3>
        1960s
    </h3>
    <p>The Marvel Comics teams of the early 1960s typically included at least one (and often the only) female member, much like
        DC's flagship <strong>superhero</strong> team the Justice League of America (whose initial roster included Wonder
        Woman as the token female); examples include the Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, the X-Men's Jean Grey (originally
        known as Marvel Girl), the Avengers' Wasp, and the Brotherhood of Mutants' Scarlet Witch (who later joined the Avengers).
        In 1963, Astro Boy was adapted into a highly influential anime television series. Phantom Agents in 1964 focused
        on ninjas working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for Sentai-type series. 1966 saw the debut
        of sci-fi/horror series Ultra Q created by Eiji Tsuburaya this would eventually lead on to the sequel Ultraman, spawning
        a successful franchise focused upon the Giant Hero subgenre where the <strong>superhero</strong>es would be as big
        as giant monsters (Kaiju) that they fought.
    </p>

    <h3>
        1970s
    </h3>
    <p>In 1972, the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman anime debuted, which built upon the <strong>superhero</strong> team idea of
        the live-action Phantom Agents as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support
        them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of Mazinger Z by
        Go Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga Cutey Honey in 1973, although the Magical
        Girl genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical
        Girl media. The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into <strong>superhero</strong> fiction such examples
        included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori's Skull Man in 1970, Go Nagai's Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John
        Romita's Punisher in 1974. The dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic
        changes. The protagonist was redesigned resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen
        Rider series. Kamen Rider is a motorcycle riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Transform) to
        don his costume and gain superhuman powers. The ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into
        the 1970s, greatly influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters:
        Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a mod-dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character
        from the British television series The Avengers (no relation to the <strong>superhero</strong> team of the same name),[26]
        but later reverted to Marston's original concept after the editors of Ms. magazine publicly disapproved of the character
        being depowered and without her traditional costume;[27] Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on Action
        Comics to headline Adventure Comics in 1969; the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of The Avengers as a group
        of mind-controlled <strong>superhero</strong>ines led by Valkyrie (actually a disguised supervillainess) and were
        meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists;[28] and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being
        known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the late 1970s, a stark contrast from her depiction
        as the weakest member of her team a decade ago. Both major publishers began introducing new <strong>superhero</strong>ines
        with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character development. Examples include Big
        Barda, Power Girl, and the Huntress by DC comics; and from Marvel, the second Black Widow, Shanna the She-Devil,
        and The Cat.[29] Female supporting characters who were successful professionals or hold positions of authority in
        their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular <strong>superhero</strong> titles from the late 1950s
        onward: Hal Jordan's love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice-President of Ferris Aircraft and later
        took over the company from her father; Medusa, who was first introduced in the Fantastic Four series, is a member
        of the Inhuman Royal Family and a prominent statesperson within her people's quasi-feudal society; and Carol Danvers,
        a decorated officer in the United States Air Force who would become a costumed <strong>superhero</strong> herself
        years later. In 1975 Shotaro Ishinomori's Himitsu Sentai Gorenger debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the
        concepts of multi-colored teams and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live-action. In 1978, Toei
        adapted Spider-Man into a live-action series. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle called Marveller that
        could transform into a giant and powerful robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei's Battle
        Fever J and now multi-colored teams not only had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with.

    <h3>Common Traits </h3>
    <p>Many <strong>superhero</strong> characters display the following traits:</p>
    <ul type=square>
        <li><em>Extraordinary powers or abilities.</em> <strong>superhero</strong> powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the
            ability to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman,
            Mockingbird, the Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial
            arts, espionage techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical
            weapons or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed
            by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or
            device (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer,
            and Wolverine's adamantium claws).</li>
        <br>
        <li>A strong <em>moral code</em>, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
            of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A <em>motivation</em>, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g.
            Wonder Woman), a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in
            justice and humanitarian service (e.g. Superman).</li>
        <br>
        <li>A secret identity that protects the <strong>superhero</strong>'s friends and family from becoming targets of his
            or her enemies, such as Clark Kent (Superman), or to protect themselves from getting arrested by the police,
            like Spider-Man, although many <strong>superhero</strong>es have a confidant (usually a friend or relative who
            has been sworn to secrecy). Most <strong>superhero</strong>es use a descriptive or metaphoric code name for their
            public deeds. However, there are also rare ones whose true identities are common public knowledge, even with
            a costumed identity (e.g. Iron Man and Captain America).</li>
        <br>
        <li>A distinctive <em>costume</em>, often used to conceal the secret identity (see Common costume features).</li>
        <br>
        <li>An underlying motif or theme that affects the hero's name, costume, personal effects, and other aspects of his or
            her character (e.g. Batman wears a bat-inspired costume, uses bat-themed equipment, and operates at night; Spider-Man
            can project artificial webbing from wrist-mounted web shooting gadgets, has a spider web pattern on his costume,
            and other spider-like abilities).</li>
        <br>
